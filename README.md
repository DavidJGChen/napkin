These are the source files for Evan Chen's _An Infinitely Large Napkin_.
You can read about the project on my [webpage](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html).

### About

_An Infinitely Large Napkin_ is a light
and mostly self-contained introduction to higher math,
roughly ranging from the undergraduate syllabus to first-year graduate topics.
The Napkin provides a general bird's-eye views of main ideas of fields
and what makes them cool or interesting.
It's less detailed than a real textbook
but more precise than pop-math books and assumes proof experience.
So for example, definitions and theorem statements
will typically be complete and precise,
but explanations for why a result "should" be true will supersede formal proofs.

### Download

You can download the [_most recent PDF_](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf)
or [generated log files](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/).
(Thanks to [aDotInTheVoid](https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid)
who helped with the initial setup of the deployment system.)

### Code

The project can be compiled on a system supporting `latexmk` and `asymptote`,
with a sufficiently recent version of TeX Live.
Simply run `latexmk`.
On a system with nix, just run `nix build`.

_Pull requests are welcome!_
You can email corrections directly to me as well.

### Community solutions

There is a community working on both human-readable and Lean4 proofs
of Napkin problems and examples. See:
